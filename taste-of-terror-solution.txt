A Taste of Terror

Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. These can be omitted once you know what to do.

You start the game with a pain in your back. You get reminded of this periodically. The reminders become more frequent until the pain gets worse, then unbearable, then you die after 103 moves. So, an early objective is to find the cause of the back pain and fix it. The gypsy woman and the spell book may prove helpful here. Or pick up more than ten items for a valuable clue.

Your ultimate objective will become clear as the story develops. The gypsy woman is a great source of information, so ask her about anything that seems relevent or anything she mentions in passing.

If you get stuck, the HINT command is very helpful, but please don't use it unless you really need to.
